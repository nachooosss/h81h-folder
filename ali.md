Dear H81H members, 

With love,
<b>H81H Leadership. </b> 
       <i><size=15>Together for glory.</size></i>





<b>Dear leaders, </b> 

I’d like to remind everyone about a few important points regarding the management of markers within the alliance. It’s crucial that we all work together to keep things organized and efficient. Below are the guidelines we need to follow:

<b>Updating inactive markers:</b> 

<b>1-If a marker has been placed for an extended period with no activity, it’s important to update or remove those that are no longer necessary. This applies mainly to:</b>

<b>♦-Rally markers:</b> If there’s no activity in the area or the rally isn’t active, please update or remove the marker.
<b>♦-Farm construction markers:</b> Once construction is completed, update the marker with a new message indicating the next resource in the sequence.

<b>2-Markers that should not be touched:</b>

<b>♦-Guardian markers:</b> These should remain unchanged as they are permanent and serve regular alliance activities.
<b>♦-Active construction markers:</b> If there’s ongoing construction, markers related to it should not be modified until the activity is completed.

<b>3-Order for farm constructions:</b>

<b>♦-Please ensure that we follow the proper sequence when marking farm constructions:</b>
Food → Wood → Stone → Gold.
<b>♦-When updating the marker, it’s helpful to add a clear message such as Stone | Next: Wood:</b> so everyone is aware of the next resource to build.

Please make sure to follow these guidelines to keep our workflow organized and avoid any misunderstandings or delays in alliance activities.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding these points, feel free to share them. Thank you all for your cooperation and commitment to the success of the alliance.

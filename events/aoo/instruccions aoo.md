Dear H81H members, 

For the upcoming Ark of Osiris event, please follow these steps to ensure our victory:

<b>1-Join the garrison leaders' rallies:</b> 
Join with T4 troops preferably, and use T3 only to fill the rally. Infantry only for these rallies.

<b>2-Quick marches to capture temples and structures:</b> 
Deploy T1 cavalry marches to capture temples, altars, and other objectives quickly.

<b>3- Join the cavalry leaders' rallies:</b> 
These rallies will attack the enemy obelisks immediately. Join with T4 and T3 (T3 only to fill the rally), cavalry only.

<b>4- Map point collection:</b> 
Make sure to collect points efficiently to maximize our advantage.

<b>5- Strategic teleportation:</b>
♦ If both obelisks (ours and the enemy’s) are captured: The designated players will TP first. The rest can teleport to either our obelisk or the enemy's as needed.

♦ If the enemy obelisk is not captured: Only the designated members will TP to our spot.

<b>6- The Ark:</b> 
Send a march with infantry and cavalry, if possible, to defend and attack the Ark when necessary.

<b>7- Substitutes:</b> 
Be on standby and ready to step in if any player is absent.

Let’s give it our all and secure the victory!

With love,
<b>H81H Leadership. </b> 
       <i><size=15>Together for glory.</size></i>
